VNS provides a number of features that make it easy to create visual novels, such as: A simple and easy-to-learn syntax Support for branching dialogue and choices Support for music and sound effects Unlike Ren'py, writing visual novel script is more like writing a story instead of a program, and the developers also have the choice to create their own implementation. How it started: The development of the VNS can be traced all the way back to the initial stages of Linpg's development. During this period, the team faced the challenge of finding an efficient method to store the dialogue. Each conversation required the storage of multiple variables, including the narrator, the actual dialogue content, associated character images, ambient background music, and various other components: Ultimately, the team opted for a design inspired by doubly linked list, but implemented using dictionary (HashMap for Java forks). This approach not only facilitated easier access to the data but also streamlined the saving process, enabling compatibility with formats like JSON or YAML. This method preserved readability while efficiently managing the dialogue. Today, the current system closely resembles our initial design, with only a few subtle refinements: compiler: ... dialogues: dialog1: head: background_image: bg1.jpg background_music: bgm1.mp3 character_images: - alice.png contents: - Hello narrator: Alice next: target: ~01 type: default previous: null ~01: background_image: bg1.jpg background_music: bgm1.mp3 character_images: - alice.png contents: - Can you hear me? narrator: Alice next: target: ~02 type: default previous: head ~02: ... dialog2: ... ... id: 1 language: English Although the overall data is easy to read, it is somewhat inconvenient to write. We came up with a dedicated dialogue editor to resolve the issue, but it's still a bit of a hassle. That is the reason why we begin to inquire about the possibility of simplifying the process. Would it be possible to make it feel like we're writing the dialogue in a Microsoft Word document? Thus, VNS is born. Example : Here is a simple example of a VNS script: [id]1 [language]English [section]dialog_example [bgi]bg1.png [display]character1.png character2.png Mabel: - Hello my name is Mabel! - How are you doing today! [hide]character1.png Dipper: - Hi Mabel! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. This script would display the background image bg1.png and the character images character1.png and character2.png . Mabel would then say \"Hello my name is Mabel!\" and \"How are you doing today!\". Next, character1.png would be hidden and Dipper would say \"Hi Mabel! I'm doing well, thanks for asking.\" Finally, the script would end. License: VNS is licensed under LGPL(GNU Lesser General Public License)-2.1-or-later .

These scripts are written in plain text files with the .vns extension. Imagine crafting a story filled with descriptions, dialogues, choices, and multimedia elements like images and music. VNS uses special tags to transform your script into an immersive experience featuring characters, backgrounds, music, and branching narratives. Let's dive into the building blocks: 1. Tags: Tags are the core elements of VNS. They instruct the program on how to display content. Enclosed in square brackets, tags help define scenes, characters, backgrounds, and more. 2. Essential tags: Here are some of the most commonly used tags in VNS: ID: [id]string Defines the unique identifier of the script. Language: [language]string Specifies the language of the script. Section: [section]string Denotes a new section in the script. Background Image: [bgi]string Sets the background image for the current and subsequent dialogues. Background Music: [bgm]string Sets the background music for the current and subsequent dialogues. Show Character(s): [show]string(s) Introduces (new) character image(s) to the scene. 3. A glimpse into storytelling: Let's put these tags into action with a simple example. Example Script [id]1 [language]English [section]dialog_example [bgm]music1.ogg [bgi]bg1.png [show]character.png Alex: - Hellow world! Explanation [id]1 : Sets the script ID to \"1\". [language]English : Specifies that the script is in English. [section]dialog_example : Begins a new section called \"dialog_example\". [bgm]music1.ogg : Plays \"music1.ogg\" as background music. [bgi]bg1.png : Displays \"bg1.png\" as the background image. [show]character.png : Shows \"character.png\" on the screen. Alex: : Indicates that the following dialogue is spoken by \"Alex\". - Hello, world! : The dialogue line spoken by the character. Expected Output When compiled, the script should produce a JSON representation like this: { \"compiler\": {...}, \"dialogues\": { \"dialog_example\": { \"head\": { \"background_image\": \"bg1.png\", \"background_music\": \"music1.ogg\", \"character_images\": [ \"character.png\" ], \"contents\": [ \"Hellow world!\" ], \"narrator\": \"Alex\" } } }, \"id\": \"1\", \"language\": \"English\" } This JSON structure represents how the script is interpreted, showing the background, music, characters, and dialogue content.

What is a VEP? VEP stands for VNS Enhancement Proposal. A VEP is a design document providing information to the VNS community, describing a new feature, syntax, or convention for the Visual Novel Script (VNS) language. VEPs are the primary mechanism for proposing significant changes to the VNS language standard and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into VNS. VEP Types VEPs can be categorized into the following types: Feature VEP : Proposes a new feature or syntax for VNS (e.g., new tags, variable systems, control flow mechanisms). Informational VEP : Provides general guidelines or information to the VNS community but does not propose a new feature. Process VEP : Describes a process surrounding VNS or proposes a change to a process (this VEP is an example of a Process VEP). VEP Status Each VEP has a status indicating its current state: Draft : The VEP is under active discussion and development. Accepted : The VEP has been approved but implementation is not yet complete.

By defining clear rules for local, global, and persistent variables, developers can streamline their code and facilitate future feature implementation within VNS. Rationale and Goals: Variables are fundamental components of any programming language, enabling developers to store and manipulate data. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish a unified approach to variable handling in VNS. This will not only enhance code readability and maintainability but also pave the way for implementing advanced features like conditional statements and explicit branching. Definition: In VNS, variables will be categorized into three types: - Local Variables : These variables are confined to specific sections and are not shared between sections. Each section can have its own set of local variables, allowing for encapsulation and modularization of code. However, developers must implement a robust system for persisting local variables if progress saving is enabled. - Global Variables : Global variables persist across sections within a particular dialogue. They are visible and accessible throughout the entire dialogue, facilitating data sharing between sections. Global variables should be carefully managed, especially when implementing progress-saving functionality. - Persistent Variables : Persistent variables transcend individual dialogues and persist across sessions or even across the entire program/system. These variables require explicit management and should be saved persistently, typically on the client's device. Syntax: Variables in VNS can store signed numbers (floats, ints), boolean, or strings. The syntax for creating and updating variables is as follows: // Local Variable Syntax: variable_name = 1 does_variable_exist = false // Global Variable Syntax: @variable_name = -3.1415926 // (Global variables must start with '@') // Persistent Variable Syntax: &variable_name = \"Hello world\" // (Persistent variables must start with '&') Optional Syntax: Additional syntax options are provided for convenience and flexibility: variable_name ++ // Increment/Decrement: Use ++ and -- to increment or decrement number variables. variable_name += 2 // Comment Number Operations variable1 = variable2 // Variable Assignment variable1 = variable2 + 21 // Complex Math Operations Rejected Idea(s): Persistent variables should start with '%' When considering the proposal that persistent variables should start with the symbol '%', it's important to acknowledge the conflict this introduces with established conventions in many programming languages. The '%' symbol is widely recognized as the modulo operator, a fundamental mathematical operator used to find the remainder of a division between two numbers. This operator is a staple in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and many others, serving as an essential tool for various calculations and logic operations. Introducing '%' as a prefix for persistent variables could lead to confusion and readability issues in code. Developers accustomed to seeing '%' used in the context of arithmetic operations might misinterpret its purpose when used as a variable prefix. This could hinder the understanding of code, especially for beginners or those working in a collaborative environment where clear and intuitive code is crucial. Furthermore, repurposing common symbols can complicate the parsing and interpretation of code by compilers and interpreters. These tools are designed to recognize specific patterns and symbols with predefined meanings. Introducing a dual role for '%' could require significant adjustments in the parsing logic, potentially leading to increased complexity and a higher likelihood of bugs in language processors.

Motivation VNS languages have maintained backward compatibility across revisions, but this may not always be the case. Specifically, the removal of the [br] tag in VNS 2 can cause scripts using this tag to malfunction in later versions. Additionally, minor differences in behavior and outcomes due to bugs or other factors can cause games to fail. To mitigate these issues, a mechanism for specifying the language version is necessary. This version specification will also help developers perform version checks, thus preventing conflicts and incompatibility. Moreover, with the introduction of VNS-server, this feature will enable the server to select the most appropriate compiler for the compiling process. Specification Syntax By default, specifying the language standard for a script file is optional, assuming the script should work regardless of the VNS compiler version. The [vns] tag specifies the language standard version: [vns] {>=, <=, !<=, !>=} <version.revision> Examples [vns]2.3 : This script is written according to VNS 2.3 standard and should only be compiled using the VNS 2.3 compiler. [vns]<=2.3 : If the script works between versions 2.0 and 2.3, this tag can be used. Note that compilers released before VNS 2.3 will not support this tag, unless using VNS-server. [vns]>=2.3 : If the script uses features introduced in VNS 2.3 and is not compatible with earlier versions. [vns]!<=2.3 : This script works with versions 1.0 through 2.3. Forward compatibility can be assumed between revisions, but forward and backward compatibility cannot be assumed between major version changes. Although not recommended, forced compatibility can be indicated using an exclamation mark. Backward Compatibility The introduction of the [vns] tag will not affect existing scripts as it introduces new functionality without altering the behavior of current tags. Rejected Ideas Allow Specifying Patch Specifying patch numbers is unnecessary due to the relatively short release cycle of patches, which only include bug fixes and guarantee forward and backward compatibility. Using == for Enforcing a Specific Version Using == is redundant and may cause confusion. To avoid this, equality is assumed when no comparison operator is used, simplifying the syntax for non-programmers and improving readability. Support for > , < , or != These operators can create unclear compatibility and introduce scripts that cannot run, such as [vns]<2.0 when 2.0 is the first release of the VNS 2 standard. Additionally, the unlikely event of a tag being removed and reintroduced makes != redundant. Higher version enforcement is preferable for maintaining script integrity. Conclusion The introduction of the [vns] tag for specifying the version of the VNS language standard addresses the need for clearer compatibility and version management in VNS scripts. By allowing script writers to specify the exact version or range of versions their scripts are compatible with, we can prevent issues arising from changes in language features and behavior between versions. This proposal not only helps maintain backward compatibility but also supports forward compatibility, facilitating smoother transitions and integrations with tools like VNS-server. By adopting this proposal, the VNS language will enhance its robustness and reliability, ensuring that scripts perform consistently across different versions of the compiler.

This enhancement aims to facilitate more complex and nested dialog structures, offering enhanced narrative flexibility when combined with existing tags such as [end], [block], and labels. Motivation In the development of Visual Novel Scripts (VNS), complex storytelling often requires dynamic transitions between dialogues that are not linear. The existing tags support basic flow control but lack the ability to efficiently implement more intricate dialogue pathways that can enhance player engagement and narrative depth. The introduction of the [jump] tag addresses this gap by allowing explicit and clear transitions, improving both the writing experience and game-play mechanics. Rationale The [jump] tag offers explicit control over dialogue flow, crucial for developing non-linear narratives and complex interaction patterns in visual novels. By providing a clear, standardized method for script branching, developers can craft more engaging and intricate stories with greater ease. Specification Syntax The [jump] tag will follow a straightforward syntax: [jump]/[jmp] <label> Where is the identifier of the dialog section to which the flow should be redirected. This label must be predefined in the script. Example Usage Consider the following script snippet: Alex: - this is not true [jump]alice_answer Alex: - or is it? [end] [label]alice_answer Alice: - why not? In this scenario, once Alex says, \"this is not true,\" the dialogue will immediately continue with Alice's response, \"why not?\" The line \"or is it?\" will not be reached unless accessed through a different [jump] command. The dialogue sequence will terminate at Alex's \"or is it?\" if reached without a preceding [jump] due to the [end] tag. Behavior with Other Tags [end]: Closes the current dialogue branch. If encountered after a [jump], the sequence does not continue past the [end]. [block]: Prevents returning to a previous dialogue point once passed, ensuring linear progression post-block unless redirected by another [jump]. Rejected Idea(s) Reusing [br] Tag Initially considered, the [br] tag was deprecated in VNS 2.0 due to its limited utility and potential confusion with the new [jump] functionality. Its reintroduction could mislead developers about supported features in the current VNS standard. Backward Compatibility The introduction of the [jump] tag will not affect existing scripts as it introduces new functionality without altering the behavior of current tags. Conclusion The [jump] tag provides a standardized mechanism for non-linear dialogue flow in VNS scripts. By enabling explicit transitions between dialogue sections, developers gain greater control over narrative structure, allowing for more complex and engaging storytelling. This enhancement integrates seamlessly with existing tags while maintaining full backwards compatibility. VEP Development Process A live draft for this VEP lives on GitHub.

Unlike background music which persists across dialogues, sound effects are one-shot audio cues tied to specific dialogue moments. This enhancement aims to enrich the audio experience in visual novels by allowing precise control over short audio clips. Motivation Visual novels rely heavily on audio to create immersive experiences. While the existing [bgm] tag handles background music effectively, there is no standardized way to trigger short sound effects during specific dialogues. Sound effects such as door knocks, footsteps, thunder, or character-specific audio cues are essential for enhancing dramatic moments and player immersion. The introduction of the [sfx] tag addresses this gap by providing a dedicated mechanism for triggering one-shot sound effects. Rationale The [sfx] tag differs from [bgm] in several key ways: Scope : Background music persists across dialogues until changed, while sound effects are cleared after each dialogue. Multiplicity : Multiple sound effects can be triggered simultaneously for a single dialogue, enabling layered audio experiences. Intent : Sound effects are designed for short audio cues, while background music handles ambient and continuous audio. By providing a separate tag for sound effects, developers gain clearer semantic distinction between different audio types, improving script readability and maintainability. Specification Syntax The [sfx] tag follows a straightforward syntax: [sfx] <sound_file1> [sound_file2] ... Or using the alternative long form: [sound-effect] <sound_file1> [sound_file2] ... Where <sound_file1> , <sound_file2> , etc., are the filenames of the sound effect files to be played. Multiple files can be specified, separated by spaces. Behavior Replacement : Each use of [sfx] clears any previously specified sound effects and sets new ones. This is similar to how [display] works for character images. One-shot : Sound effects are automatically cleared after the dialogue is processed. They do not persist to subsequent dialogues. Multiple files : When multiple sound effect files are specified, they should all be triggered for the current dialogue. Example Usage Basic Usage [sfx]doorbell.wav Alice: - Someone's at the door! In this example, the doorbell sound effect plays when Alice's dialogue appears. Multiple Sound Effects [sfx]thunder.wav rain.wav Narrator: - The storm raged outside the window. Here, both thunder and rain sound effects are triggered simultaneously. Sequential Dialogues [sfx]footsteps.wav Alice: - Did you hear that? Bob: - Hear what? The footsteps sound effect only plays for Alice's dialogue. Bob's dialogue has no sound effects because they are cleared after each dialogue. Combining with Background Music [bgm]suspense.mp3 [sfx]creaking_door.wav Alice: - This house gives me the creeps... The background music continues playing while the sound effect is triggered for this specific dialogue. Backward Compatibility The introduction of the [sfx] tag will not affect existing scripts as it introduces new functionality without altering the behavior of current tags. Scripts that do not use the [sfx] tag will continue to work as expected. Rejected Idea(s) Reusing [bgm] Tag with Parameters An alternative approach considered was extending the [bgm] tag to accept a parameter distinguishing between background music and sound effects. This was rejected because: It conflates two semantically different concepts It would complicate the behavior of an existing, well-understood tag It would not naturally support the one-shot clearing behavior needed for sound effects Persistent Sound Effects Another approach considered was having sound effects persist like background music until explicitly changed. This was rejected because: Sound effects are typically short and meant for specific moments Accidental persistence could lead to unwanted repeated audio The one-shot behavior aligns better with common visual novel conventions Conclusion The [sfx] tag provides a standardized mechanism for triggering sound effects in VNS scripts. By enabling precise control over one-shot audio cues, developers can create more immersive and dynamic audio experiences. This enhancement integrates seamlessly with existing audio tags while maintaining full backwards compatibility. VEP Development Process A live draft for this VEP lives on GitHub.
