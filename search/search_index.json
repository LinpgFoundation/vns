During this period, the team faced the challenge of finding an efficient method to store the dialogue. Each conversation required the storage of multiple variables, including the narrator, the actual dialogue content, associated character images, ambient background music, and various other components:</p> <p></p> <p>Ultimately, the team opted for a design inspired by doubly linked list, but implemented using dictionary (HashMap for Java forks). This approach not only facilitated easier access to the data but also  streamlined the saving process, enabling compatibility with formats like JSON or YAML. This method preserved readability while efficiently  managing the dialogue. Today, the current system closely resembles our initial design, with only a few subtle refinements:</p> <pre><code>compiler: ...\ndialogues:\n  dialog1:\n    head:\n      background_image: bg1.jpg\n      background_music: bgm1.mp3\n      character_images:\n      - alice.png\n      contents:\n      - Hello\n      narrator: Alice\n      next:\n        target: ~01\n        type: default\n      previous: null\n    ~01:\n      background_image: bg1.jpg\n      background_music: bgm1.mp3\n      character_images:\n      - alice.png\n      contents:\n      - Can you hear me?\n      narrator: Alice\n      next:\n        target: ~02\n        type: default\n      previous: head\n    ~02:\n    ...\n  dialog2:\n    ...\n  ...\nid: 1\nlanguage: English\n</code></pre> <p>Although the overall data is easy to read, it is somewhat inconvenient to write. We came up with a dedicated dialogue editor to resolve the issue, but it's still a bit of a hassle. That is the reason why we begin to inquire about the possibility of simplifying the process.</p> <p>Would it be possible to make it feel like we're writing the dialogue in a Microsoft Word document? Thus, VNS is born.</p>"},{"location":"#example","title":"Example:","text":"<p>Here is a simple example of a VNS script:</p> <pre><code>[id]1\n[language]English\n\n[section]dialog_example\n\n[bgi]bg1.png\n[display]character1.png character2.png\n\nMabel:\n- Hello my name is Mabel!\n- How are you doing today!\n\n[hide]character1.png\n\nDipper:\n- Hi Mabel!

By allowing script writers to specify the exact version or range of versions their scripts are compatible with, we can prevent issues arising from changes in language features and behavior between versions. This proposal not only helps maintain backward compatibility but also supports forward compatibility, facilitating smoother transitions and integrations with tools like VNS-server. By adopting this proposal, the VNS language will enhance its robustness and reliability, ensuring that scripts perform consistently across different versions of the compiler.</p>"},{"location":"vep/2-Language%20Standard%20and%20Compiler%20Version%20Management/#vep-development-process","title":"VEP Development Process","text":"<p>A live draft for this VEP lives on GitHub.
